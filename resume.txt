1️⃣ Guardrails (This Is Critical for Regulatory)
You need to speak about guardrails at 3 layers:
Layer A – Input Guardrails
Prompt injection detection
Query sanitization
Length limits
Content classification before LLM call
Role-based access control
You can say:
“Before passing user input to the LLM, I would introduce a classification layer to detect prompt injection attempts, irrelevant requests, or policy violations. This prevents the model from executing unintended instructions.”
Bonus:
Mention embedding similarity threshold to reject unrelated queries.
Layer B – Retrieval Guardrails
Similarity threshold minimum score
Source filtering by document type
Approved document repository only
No open web retrieval in regulatory use case
Say:
“In regulated environments, retrieval should be restricted to curated, version-controlled documentation to ensure traceability and auditability.”
That line scores points.

Layer C – Output Guardrails
Response grounded strictly in retrieved context
Citation requirement
Confidence scoring
LLM output classifier pass
Rule-based validator before final answer
Strong answer:
“I would require the model to cite retrieved document IDs and apply a secondary validation layer to ensure the answer is grounded. If grounding confidence is low, the system escalates to human review.”
That sounds enterprise-ready.

2️⃣ Prompt Engineering (They Will Probe This)
You need to show maturity beyond “write a better prompt.”
Discuss Structured Prompts
Role definition
Explicit constraints
Output schema
Deterministic formatting
Controlled verbosity
Example:
Instead of:
“Answer the question.”
You say:
“The prompt enforces structured outputs with explicit instruction boundaries, prevents speculation, and limits response scope to retrieved context only.”
Mention:
Temperature control
Top-p tuning
Deterministic mode for regulatory usage
For regulatory systems:
“I would reduce temperature close to zero to prioritize determinism over creativity.”
That line is gold in this room.

3️⃣ Human Validation (Very Important Here)
Regulatory engineering means:
AI cannot be final authority.
Prepare this framework:
Human-in-the-Loop Model
Level 1 – AI Suggestion Only
Level 2 – AI Draft with Human Approval
Level 3 – AI Assisted + Automated for Low Risk
You should say:
“In regulatory workflows, AI should initially operate in an assistive mode. Human approval remains mandatory until confidence thresholds and performance metrics justify partial automation.”
Then add:
Feedback loop for reinforcement
Error logging
Continuous retraining based on validated corrections
That shows lifecycle thinking.

4️⃣ Reasoning Engine on User Queries
They may ask:
“How does your system reason?”
Be precise.
Your current system:
Retrieves context
Passes context + question into LLM
Uses instruction template
Returns generated result
But for enterprise scale, expand it:
Multi-Step Reasoning Architecture
Intent classification
Query decomposition
Retrieval per sub-query
Context aggregation
Reasoned synthesis
Structured output generation
Say:
“For complex regulatory queries, I would decompose the question into sub-components, retrieve supporting evidence for each, then synthesize a structured response.”
That makes you sound principal-level.

5️⃣ Hallucination Mitigation Strategy
They will ask this.
Your strong answer:
Strict retrieval grounding
Low temperature
No external knowledge fallback
Citation enforcement
Confidence threshold
Escalation path
If unsure:
“If retrieval confidence falls below threshold, the system should respond with ‘Insufficient validated data’ rather than attempt generation.”
That sounds safe.

6️⃣ Auditability (Very Important for This Panel)
Mention logging:
User query
Retrieved documents
Similarity scores
Prompt version
Model version
Output
Timestamp
Say:
“Every interaction should be reproducible for audit purposes. Prompt versioning and model versioning are critical in regulated environments.”
That line scores heavily with Regulatory Directors.

7️⃣ Scaling & Enterprise Concerns
Be ready to discuss:
Caching embeddings
Batch embedding during ingestion
Horizontal scaling of vector DB
Stateless API layer
API gateway with rate limiting
Secrets management
Role-based access control
Mention:
“For enterprise deployment, I would containerize the service, isolate the retrieval layer, and decouple embedding generation from inference to manage cost.”
Very strong signal.

8️⃣ If They Ask: “What Are the Risks?”
Say:
Hallucination
Prompt injection
Data leakage
Model drift
Latency
Over-reliance by users
Then follow with mitigation strategies.
Always follow risk with mitigation.

9️⃣ One Very Likely Question
“Would you use this in a regulated production system as-is?”
Correct answer:
“No. This is a proof-of-concept. A production system would require guardrails, access control, logging, monitoring, validation workflows, and governance integration.”
That shows maturity.

10️⃣ The Tone You Must Carry
Do NOT:
Defend your Streamlit demo too much.
Get excited about Gemini features.
Over-focus on tooling.
DO:
Talk about risk
Talk about process
Talk about governance
Talk about scaling
Talk about auditability
This is Regulatory Engineering.
Safety > Flashiness.
1️⃣ How do you prevent hallucination?
Model Answer:
“Hallucination risk is primarily controlled through strict retrieval grounding and constrained generation.
First, the model is only allowed to respond using retrieved, version-controlled documents — no open-ended external knowledge.
Second, I enforce citation requirements so each response must reference specific document chunks.
Third, I reduce temperature close to zero to prioritize determinism over creativity.
Finally, if retrieval confidence falls below a defined similarity threshold, the system is designed to return ‘Insufficient validated information’ instead of generating speculative content.”
That answer shows:
Technical understanding
Governance mindset
Risk containment

2️⃣ How do you control AI risk?
Model Answer:
“I approach AI risk at three levels: input, processing, and output.
At the input layer, I implement prompt injection detection and role-based access control.
At the processing layer, retrieval is limited to curated, version-controlled documents.
At the output layer, responses are validated, logged, and confidence-scored before presentation.
In regulatory environments, AI should initially operate in an assistive mode with human validation before moving toward higher automation.”
This sounds structured and executive.

3️⃣ How is output validated?
Model Answer:
“Validation occurs in two ways: automated and human.
Automated validation includes grounding checks, citation verification, and output schema enforcement.
If confidence scores fall below threshold, the system routes the response for human review.
Over time, validated corrections are logged to improve retrieval accuracy and prompt refinement.”
You show lifecycle thinking here.

4️⃣ Can this be audited?
Model Answer:
“Yes — auditability is critical in regulatory use cases.
Every interaction should log the user query, retrieved document IDs, similarity scores, prompt version, model version, generated output, and timestamp.
This ensures the response is fully reproducible and traceable.
Prompt versioning and model versioning are particularly important for compliance tracking.”
Regulatory directors will like this.

5️⃣ What happens if it gives wrong advice?
Model Answer:
“The system must never be positioned as a final authority in regulated workflows.
If incorrect guidance is detected, the response should be flagged, logged, and reviewed.
The corrected answer feeds back into retrieval tuning and prompt adjustment.
More importantly, workflow design should ensure human approval remains mandatory for high-risk decisions.”
Notice: you didn’t panic. You contained it.

6️⃣ Why MMR?
Model Answer:
“I chose Max Marginal Relevance to balance relevance with diversity in retrieved results.
In regulatory documents, similar sections often contain overlapping language. MMR helps avoid returning redundant chunks and instead retrieves broader contextual support, which improves reasoning quality.”
That’s a principal-level explanation.

7️⃣ Why Gemini vs others?
Do NOT sound defensive here.
Model Answer:
“The choice of Gemini was pragmatic for this prototype due to integration convenience and embedding performance.
In enterprise deployment, model selection should depend on latency, cost, data residency, and compliance requirements.
The architecture itself is model-agnostic and can support other LLM providers if required.”
This shows maturity and flexibility.

8️⃣ Latency considerations?
Model Answer:
“Latency comes from three components: embedding retrieval, vector search, and model inference.
For production, embeddings should be precomputed during ingestion, vector search optimized with indexed ANN structures, and inference endpoints horizontally scaled.
Caching frequently asked queries can significantly reduce response time.”
Good. Practical. Not theoretical.

9️⃣ Scaling Vector DB?
Model Answer:
“Vector databases scale horizontally by sharding embeddings across nodes and leveraging approximate nearest neighbor indexing.
For enterprise scale, ingestion should be decoupled from inference, and embedding updates should be version-controlled.
Monitoring retrieval performance metrics is critical as corpus size grows.”
That sounds engineering-focused.

🔟 Stateless vs Stateful Sessions?
Model Answer:
“For regulatory environments, stateless APIs are generally safer and more scalable.
Context required for reasoning can be reconstructed per request through retrieval rather than relying on persistent conversational memory.
Stateful sessions may be used selectively for user experience, but core regulatory decisions should remain context-reproducible.”
This is a strong regulatory answer.

1️⃣1️⃣ Cost Control?
Model Answer:
“Cost control involves optimizing token usage, batching embedding jobs, caching frequent responses, and using smaller models for low-risk tasks.
Not every query requires a large model — model routing strategies can significantly reduce operational cost.”
They will appreciate cost awareness.

1️⃣2️⃣ Failure Modes?
Strong answer:
“Key failure modes include hallucination, prompt injection, retrieval mismatch, model downtime, and latency spikes.
Mitigation strategies include strict grounding, input filtering, fallback responses, circuit breakers for model APIs, and human escalation pathways.”
This shows operational maturity.

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to apply for the Solution Architect role within ST Engineering’s Mission Software & Services business. With over 20 years of experience delivering enterprise-grade, mission-critical digital solutions across Singapore’s government, defence, and regulated sectors, I bring deep alignment with the objectives of the Government Digital Solutions Business Unit.

In my previous role at the Government Technology Agency (GovTech), I led Whole-of-Government solution architecture initiatives spanning cloud platforms, AI-enabled systems, and multi-agency integrations. I served as a trusted technical advisor to senior government stakeholders, authored and secured Cabinet-level approvals for national technology adoption, and governed the design and delivery of secure, scalable platforms deployed at national scale.

Across both public and private sectors, I have consistently worked at the intersection of architecture leadership, OEM collaboration, and programme delivery. At Motorola Solutions and Alcatel-Lucent, I partnered closely with enterprise software and platform teams to shape solution roadmaps, close architectural gaps, and deliver mission-critical systems aligned with stringent security and compliance requirements. More recently, as an independent solution architect, I have continued to design modular, reusable architectures and oversee end-to-end delivery through deployment and operational handover.
What particularly attracts me to ST Engineering is the opportunity to contribute to Singapore’s digital government vision through enterprise platforms, secure systems integration, and AI-enabled decision support. I believe my experience in Whole-of-Government architecture, multi-agency stakeholder engagement, and delivery governance would allow me to add immediate value to the Mission Software & Services team.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background and approach to solution architecture can support ST Engineering’s continued success in delivering impactful, secure, and scalable government digital solutions.

Yours sincerely,
Freddy Goh Choon Kwang

My experience spans Physical AI systems including robotics, autonomous sensing platforms, AI-enabled surveillance, computer vision, IoT, and cloud-based platforms. Notably, I led the deployment of the Boston Dynamics SPOT robot for public safety operations during COVID-19, delivering under compressed timelines and high operational scrutiny.

I have extensive experience managing project financials, vendors, subcontractors, and cross-functional teams, as well as leading pre-sales and tender responses for public sector and defence-related projects. I am comfortable engaging senior stakeholders, negotiating scope and change control, and ensuring delivery outcomes meet contractual, operational, and security requirements.
I am Singaporean with CAT 2 clearance and have spent a significant portion of my career operating in regulated and security-sensitive environments. I am motivated by opportunities that require both strong delivery leadership and the ability to translate emerging technologies into real-world, operational outcomes.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience in Physical AI delivery, public sector programs, and complex system integration can contribute to your organisation’s objectives.

Yours sincerely,
Freddy Goh Choon Kwang

My background in designing end-to-end architectures—including 3G/4G/5G, cloud, NFV/SDN, IoT platforms, data analytics, and sensor technologies—positions me well to contribute to SG Courts’ potential consolidation of case management systems and development of a unified enterprise architecture.

I also bring a strong track record in business process re-engineering and digital transformation. Across GovTech and Singtel. , I engaged senior stakeholders to map workflows, redesign processes for efficiency, remove fragmentation, and implement new operating models. I have collaborated extensively with vendors, R&D teams, and policy leaders to ensure project alignment with user needs, regulatory constraints, and long-term strategy—skills critical for steering transformation initiatives across the Judiciary’s multi-court environment.

The Judiciary’s commitment to integrity, impartiality, and public trust resonates deeply with me. Having worked on national initiatives with high public impact, I value disciplined governance, transparency, and the responsibility of designing systems that directly affect citizens’ experiences and rights. I am motivated by the opportunity to help SG Courts strengthen access to justice through technology that is robust, equitable, and user-centric.

I welcome the opportunity to contribute my experience in enterprise architecture, digital transformation, and multi-stakeholder project leadership to the SG Courts’ transformation journey. I would be pleased to discuss how my background can support ITX’s mission of shaping a modern, integrated, and trusted justice system.
Thank you for your consideration.

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Director, Solution Sales Engineering – Asia role at Parallel Wireless. With over 20 years of experience supporting Tier-1 Mobile Network Operators across Asia, Europe, and the US, I have spent my career at the intersection of sales, network architecture, and customer trust, helping operators adopt and scale 3G, 4G, and 5G solutions in complex, real-world environments.

I have consistently operated as a trusted technical advisor to CTOs, Heads of Network, and Engineering Directors, supporting sales leadership through the full technical sales lifecycle — from discovery and solution positioning, through proposal defense, PoCs, and early deployment. My background spans RAN, OSS/OAM, and core network architectures, including cloud-native and virtualized deployments, enabling me to clearly articulate both the technical value and operational impact of new network approaches such as Open RAN.

Across roles in Alcatel-Lucent, Singtel, Motorola Solutions, and GovTech Singapore, I have worked on both the vendor and operator sides of the table. This dual perspective allows me to understand how MNOs evaluate risk, performance, and long-term operability — and how solution sales teams can position innovation in a way that builds confidence rather than friction. I have led and defended multi-million-dollar proposals, supported competitive bids against incumbent vendors, and partnered closely with product and R&D teams to translate customer requirements into actionable roadmaps.
In my current advisory role, I continue to support customer-facing technical sales engagements, documenting end-to-end solutions, developing executive-level materials, and acting as the technical bridge between customers, sales, and engineering teams. I am comfortable operating independently across multiple pursuits, prioritizing effectively, and traveling regionally to maintain strong relationships with key technical stakeholders.

Parallel Wireless’ mission to redefine mobile networks through energy-efficient, open, and software-driven RAN solutions strongly resonates with me. I am particularly motivated by opportunities where innovation must be paired with credibility, clarity, and disciplined execution — qualities I bring to every customer engagement.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience can support Parallel Wireless’ growth in Asia and help your customers confidently adopt Open RAN at scale.

Yours sincerely,
Freddy Goh Choon Kwang

With over 20 years of experience delivering complex, compliance-sensitive technology and AI programmes across telecom, government, and enterprise environments, I bring a strong track record of managing AI initiatives within regulated engineering contexts.

In my current role as an independent AI Technical Project Management Advisor, I manage hands-on delivery of AI-enabled solutions, ensuring projects remain on track against scope, schedule, quality, and compliance objectives, while driving continuous process improvement across delivery teams.

At the Government Technology Agency of Singapore, I managed national-scale AI and intelligent systems programmes involving multiple agencies and industry partners, operating within strict public-sector governance and assurance frameworks. These programmes required balancing innovation with regulatory compliance, documentation rigor, and long-term operational sustainability—capabilities directly relevant to global product compliance and regulatory engineering environments.

Earlier in my career at Motorola Solutions, Singtel, and Nokia Bell Labs, I led delivery of mission-critical and standards-driven telecom and wireless systems across multiple markets. This work involved close collaboration with global R&D teams, adherence to telecom and network standards, and delivery of systems meeting carrier-grade compliance, performance, and safety expectations. This background has given me a strong foundation in working within standards-based engineering ecosystems similar to those governing product safety, EMC, and wireless compliance.

Throughout my career, I have led AI- and data-driven projects operating under stringent safety, security, standards, and regulatory requirements. My experience spans end-to-end project delivery—defining scope, schedules, quality criteria, and governance—while coordinating closely with AI/ML engineers, product engineering teams, compliance stakeholders, and external partners to ensure successful outcomes.

I am particularly drawn to this role due to its intersection of AI, engineering delivery, and regulatory assurance, and the opportunity to contribute as a hands-on advisor within a globally distributed, cross-functional team. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience can support your organisation’s product compliance and AI delivery objectives.


Thank you for your time and consideration.

Yours sincerely,

“Can you walk me through your background?”
What they’re testing:
Clarity, seniority, relevance, and whether you can tell a coherent story in 90 seconds.
Strong Answer (Use This Structure)
“I’ve spent over 20 years delivering complex technology programs in government, security, and mission-critical environments. Most recently at Singapore’s Government Technology Agency, I led multi-year, multi-million-dollar national programs involving cloud, IoT, AI, and robotics, with full ownership from planning through field deployment and operations.
Earlier, I worked in public safety and national infrastructure roles at Motorola Solutions, Singtel, and Alcatel-Lucent, coordinating closely with US and European engineering teams while delivering programs across Asia.
What ties my experience together is running real, high-risk programs in regulated environments — aligning stakeholders, managing delivery risk, and ensuring operational success. That’s why the Field AI role stood out to me.”

2. “Why are you interested in Field AI?”
What they’re testing:
Motivation, alignment, and whether you’ve done your homework.
Strong Answer
“What attracted me to Field AI is the focus on deploying AI and autonomous systems safely and reliably in real-world, unstructured environments. I’ve spent much of my career operating in similar conditions — public spaces, security contexts, and government deployments — where trust, explainability, and execution matter as much as the technology itself.
This role combines large-scale program ownership, Asia-based delivery, and advanced robotics, which is a very natural fit for my background.”

3. “What is your experience with large or complex programs?”
What they’re testing:
Scale, ownership, and delivery credibility.
Strong Answer
“At GovTech, I owned the end-to-end delivery of a S$3.7M national Smart Nation Wireless Sensor Network, including budgeting, vendor management, cloud deployment, operations, and maintenance. The program spanned multiple agencies and required tight milestones, risk management, and executive-level reporting.
I’ve also led robotics and AI-enabled field deployments, where operational readiness and safety were critical. These weren’t pilots on paper — they were real deployments in public environments.”

4. “Have you worked directly with customers or external stakeholders?”
What they’re testing:
Customer-facing confidence and maturity.
Strong Answer
“Yes — customer and stakeholder engagement has been central to my roles. In government, that meant working directly with ministries, agencies, and senior decision-makers.
In my Singtel role, I secured senior management buy-in across multiple Asia-based telecom operators for the adoption of a multi-beam antenna solution, aligning diverse technical and commercial priorities. I’m very comfortable being the primary point of contact and representing delivery commitments.”

5. “Tell me about a challenging program or risk you had to manage.”
What they’re testing:
Judgment, calm under pressure, and realism.
Strong Answer
“One example was leading an AI-enabled robotics deployment in a public environment under tight timelines and high visibility. Key risks included safety, public perception, and system reliability.
I mitigated this through staged deployments, clear go/no-go milestones, close coordination with engineering teams, and continuous communication with stakeholders. The program was delivered successfully without incidents and built confidence for future deployments.”

6. “Are you comfortable working with ambiguity?”
What they’re testing:
Startup fit.
Strong Answer
“Yes. Many of the programs I’ve led did not start with fully defined requirements or structures. My approach is to establish clarity early — defining objectives, milestones, decision rights, and risk frameworks — and then adapt as the program evolves. I’m comfortable creating structure where it doesn’t yet exist.”

7. “Why are you looking for a new role now?”
(or) “Can you explain your recent career gap?”
What they’re testing:
Stability and readiness.
Best Answer (Keep It Short)
“I took time away from full-time employment to be the primary caregiver for my children during a family transition. That chapter is now complete, and I’m fully available and intentionally returning to long-term, high-responsibility program leadership roles.”
Then stop. Do not elaborate unless asked.

8. “What are your start date and location preferences?”
What they’re testing:
Logistics and risk.
Strong Answer
“I can be available within a 2–4 week notice period, and I’m comfortable working closely with US-based teams while supporting Asia-based customer deplo#yments.”

9. “Do you have any questions for me?”
This is where you use the questions list we prepared earlier.

10. Recruiter:
“Freddy, thanks for taking the time today. To start off, could you briefly walk me through your background and what brings you to explore the Program Manager role at Field AI?”
“I’ve spent over 20 years leading complex, mission-critical programs in government, security, and regulated environments.
Most recently at Singapore’s Government Technology Agency, I led a multi-year, multi-million-dollar national wireless sensor network spanning multiple ministries. I owned end-to-end delivery — from budgeting and stakeholder alignment through field deployment, operations, and maintenance — across hardware, wireless connectivity, IoT, cloud platforms, and AI-enabled and robotic systems.
Earlier in my career, I worked in public safety and national infrastructure roles at Motorola Solutions, Singtel, and Alcatel-Lucent, coordinating closely with US and European engineering teams while delivering programs for Asian government and operator customers.
What ties my experience together is running real, high-risk programs in regulated environments — aligning senior stakeholders, managing delivery and operational risk, and ensuring systems work reliably in the field. That’s why the Program Manager role at Field AI stood out to me.”

Recruiter:
“How do you see your background aligning with what Field AI is looking for in this Program Manager role?”
Field AI is focused on deploying autonomous systems safely and reliably in real-world, unstructured environments. That aligns closely with my background delivering complex, field-deployed systems under real operational and regulatory constraints.
I’ve led multi-year, multi-million-dollar programs where success depended not just on technology, but on disciplined execution — clear milestones, risk management, stakeholder alignment, and operational readiness. At GovTech, Motorola Solutions, Singtel, and Alcatel-Lucent, I worked directly with senior government and enterprise stakeholders to translate advanced technology into deployable, trusted systems.
I see this role as a natural extension of what I’ve been doing — owning large, high-stakes programs, coordinating across engineering and deployment teams, and ensuring customer programs in Asia deliver on time, safely, and at scale.”
Recruiter:
“Can you tell me about one of the most complex programs you’ve led, and how you ensured it stayed on track?”
“One of the most complex programs I led was Singapore’s national wireless sensor network under the Smart Nation initiative. It was a multi-year, multi-million-dollar program involving multiple government agencies, each with different operational requirements, alongside a fixed budget, firm national deadlines, and multiple vendors, including overseas suppliers.
My role was to own end-to-end delivery. I worked with each agency to clarify their requirements, align on shared outcomes, and translate those into a common delivery roadmap with clear milestones. In parallel, I coordinated with local and overseas vendors to structure deployment plans, manage dependencies, and mitigate risks related to supply, integration, and timelines.
To keep the program on track, I focused on strong governance — regular milestone reviews, risk tracking, and transparent communication with senior stakeholders. This approach allowed us to deliver the program within agreed timelines while maintaining operational readiness for long-term operations and maintenance.
The experience is directly relevant to Field AI, where programs involve distributed teams, international coordination, and the need to align diverse stakeholders around a common operational goal.”
Recruiter:
“This role involves working with very senior and sometimes difficult stakeholders. How do you typically handle situations where there are conflicting priorities or expectations?”
“In senior stakeholder environments, I’ve found that most conflicts come from misaligned priorities rather than true disagreement.
In my time at Singtel, I regularly worked with senior management teams who had competing objectives and constraints. My approach was to first establish a shared understanding of the program’s overall goal and success criteria. I would then surface trade-offs early — cost, timeline, performance — and work with internal teams to propose a prioritized, realistic plan.
When engaging stakeholders, I focus on explaining why certain priorities matter, not for convenience, but for the long-term success and sustainability of the program. This approach helps build trust and allows stakeholders to buy into decisions, even when compromises are required.
I’ve found that clarity, transparency, and consistency are key to maintaining alignment at senior levels.”
Recruiter:
“Can you share an example of a time when something didn’t go as planned, and how you handled it?”
In complex programs, something going off track is almost inevitable. One example was during a national deployment where a key vendor faced delays that threatened our delivery milestones.
My first step was to identify the root cause — whether it was supply chain, resourcing, or integration issues — rather than reacting to symptoms. Once we understood the constraint, I worked with both internal teams and the vendor to re-sequence parts of the deployment, adjust milestones where necessary, and put additional controls in place to manage risk.
Throughout this process, I kept senior stakeholders informed with clear options and trade-offs, so there were no surprises. As a result, we were able to recover the schedule and deliver the program without compromising operational readiness.
The key for me is staying structured under pressure and focusing on solutions that protect the overall program outcome.”
Recruiter:
“This role involves working with teams across time zones and occasional travel in Asia. How comfortable are you with that?”
I’m very comfortable working across time zones and traveling when needed. In my previous roles, I worked closely with US and European teams, and I’ve managed both virtual and on-site collaboration effectively.
During my time at Singtel, I also traveled across Asia to support program delivery and stakeholder engagement. I see travel and time zone coordination as a normal part of delivering complex, international programs, especially in field-facing roles like this one.”
Recruiter:
“Do you have any questions for me?”
Could you share what the next steps in the interview process look like? And at a high level, where the customer program in Asia is today — whether it’s still in early planning or already moving into deployment?”



1. “Tell me about a program you ran where failure was not an option.”
What the HM is testing
Real delivery pressure
Ownership under scrutiny
Safety / public impact awareness
Model Answer (You)
“At GovTech, I led a national wireless sensor network program supporting multiple government agencies. The program was highly visible, had a fixed national timeline, and involved public-space deployment, so failure would have had operational and reputational consequences.
I owned end-to-end delivery — budget, vendors, field deployment, and ongoing operations. My focus was on early risk identification, especially around integration, deployment readiness, and long-term maintainability. We established clear milestones, strong governance, and regular senior reviews to ensure issues surfaced early.
The program was delivered in a way that met both policy expectations and operational realities, and it’s still running today.”
What to emphasize: longevity + operational reality
2. “How do you work with robotics engineers if you’re not one yourself?”
What the HM is testing
Will you interfere or enable?
Can you speak their language?
Model Answer
“I don’t try to be the engineer in the room. My role is to ensure engineers can focus on solving the right problems while I manage constraints around scope, risk, timelines, and customer expectations.
I make sure I understand system-level behavior — interfaces, dependencies, failure modes, and operational constraints — so I can ask the right questions and translate between engineering teams and customers.
In previous robotics and AI deployments, this approach helped reduce friction and ensured technical decisions were aligned with real-world deployment needs.”
HM green flag: “system-level understanding”
3. “Robotics programs often slip. How do you handle schedule pressure?”
What the HM is testing
Realism vs optimism
Ability to protect engineers
Model Answer
“I assume schedules will come under pressure and plan for that early. I break programs into clear milestones with explicit risk buffers, especially around integration and field deployment.
When slippage occurs, I focus on root causes and trade-offs rather than pushing teams blindly. I surface options early to stakeholders — whether that’s adjusting scope, sequencing, or deployment plans — so decisions are made consciously rather than reactively.”
4. “How do you manage safety and risk in field deployments?”
What the HM is testing
Do you understand real-world robotics risk?
Model Answer
“In field deployments, safety and reliability come before feature completeness. I work with engineering teams to understand operational limits, edge cases, and failure modes, and ensure those are reflected in deployment plans and operating procedures.
In public-space deployments, we’ve used phased rollouts, controlled environments, and clear escalation procedures to manage risk while still gathering real-world learning.”
5. “How would you approach building a team in Singapore from scratch?”
What the HM is testing
Leadership + pragmatism
Scaling mindset
Model Answer
“I would start by clarifying what capabilities are essential in the first phase — program execution, local stakeholder engagement, and field operations.
Early hires should be versatile and comfortable operating in ambiguity. I’d put lightweight governance in place first — clear roles, decision paths, and communication rhythms — and let process mature as the team scales.”
6. “How do you handle conflicting customer and engineering priorities?”
What the HM is testing
Can you say “no” constructively?
Model Answer
“I focus on making trade-offs explicit. I work with engineering teams to understand technical constraints and then frame options for customers in terms of impact — timeline, risk, and operational outcomes.
I’ve found that customers are willing to compromise when they understand the reasoning and see that decisions are being made in the best interest of long-term success.”
7. “What worries you most about this role?”
What the HM is testing
Self-awareness
Risk honesty
Model Answer
“The biggest challenge is always aligning early expectations with real-world deployment realities, especially in new programs. That’s where disciplined program management, early stakeholder engagement, and transparent communication become critical.”
8. “Why Field AI, specifically?”
What the HM is testing
Depth of interest
Not just ‘cool robots’
Model Answer
“What attracted me to Field AI is the focus on deploying autonomous systems safely and reliably in unstructured environments. My background has been about taking advanced technology out of controlled settings and making it work in real-world, regulated environments.
This role aligns closely with my experience — not just building plans, but ensuring sustained, operational success.”
9. “How do you measure success as a Program Manager?”
What the HM is testing
Outcome orientation
Model Answer
“Success means the system is deployed, trusted by customers, and operable long after launch. That includes meeting delivery milestones, but also ensuring the program can sustain operations, adapt to change, and scale responsibly.”
10. “What would your first 90 days look like?”
What the HM is testing
Practical thinking
No grandstanding
Model Answer
“My first focus would be understanding the customer, the product’s current deployment readiness, and the team’s capabilities. I’d establish clear milestones, risk tracking, and communication rhythms, while building relationships with engineering and local stakeholders.
The goal would be to move quickly, but deliberately, toward a stable first deployment.”
Final Hiring Manager Impression If You Answer Like This
“This candidate understands robotics delivery without pretending to be a roboticist. He reduces execution risk and can be trusted with a sensitive customer.”
That is exactly what Field AI needs.
If you want next:
We can simulate a hiring manager interview (much tougher than recruiter)
Or I can help you prepare one flagship story you reuse across multiple questions
Or we can tune answers specifically for AI autonomy engineers
Just tell me which direction you want to go.

Dear Hiring Team,
I’m writing to express my interest in the Program Manager role at Field AI and to highlight my experience delivering large-scale, mission-critical programs that closely mirror the scope and demands of this position.
I have led multi-year, multi-million-dollar government technology programs with full end-to-end ownership across planning, execution, risk management, and delivery. As an Executive Manager at Singapore’s Government Technology Agency (GovTech), I was responsible for the delivery of a S$3.7M national Smart Nation Wireless Sensor Network, overseeing field deployment, vendor management, budgeting, finance, operations, maintenance, and cloud infrastructure. These programs required strong operational discipline, clearly defined milestones, and active risk mitigation to ensure on-time, high-quality outcomes in highly visible public environments.
Beyond execution, my role required operating at the intersection of policy, security, and delivery. I secured Cabinet-level approval for the nationwide adoption wireless connectivity for whole of government, translating technical and operational realities into policy decisions while ensuring downstream execution readiness. This experience reflects my ability to work effectively with senior government stakeholders and to build alignment and buy-in for complex, high-impact initiatives.
I have also led AI- and robotics-enabled field deployments under real-world constraints. This included program-managing a cloud-based IoT and computer-vision, machine learning platform integrating sensor fusion and autonomous robotics, as well as leading the trial deployment of a Boston Dynamics robot for security and situational-awareness use cases. These efforts required close coordination across engineering teams, vendors, and government stakeholders, alongside disciplined risk management related to safety, public exposure, and operational reliability.
Earlier in my career, I worked across public safety, national infrastructure, and mission-critical communications environments at Motorola Solutions, Singtel, and Alcatel-Lucent. At Singtel, I successfully achieved buy-in from senior management teams across multiple Asia-based telecom operators for the adoption of a multi-beam antenna solution, demonstrating my ability to influence executive stakeholders, align diverse interests, and drive regional adoption of complex technologies. I also collaborated extensively with US and European engineering organizations while delivering programs for Asian government and operator customers, giving me deep familiarity with Asia-facing delivery and cross-cultural stakeholder management.
What draws me to Field AI is the focus on deploying AI and autonomous systems safely, explainably, and reliably in unstructured environments. I am particularly motivated by roles where program leadership is measured not just by plans, but by sustained delivery, customer trust, and operational success in sensitive security settings.
I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience delivering government-trusted programs across Asia can support the successful execution of Field AI’s customer deployments.
Warm regards,
Freddy Goh Choon Kwang

What types of solutions or industries have you most experience designing for?
I have primarily designed end-to-end solutions across telecommunications, public safety, and smart infrastructure, with my strongest and most extensive experience in Internet of Things (IoT) systems.
My work typically involves integrating hardware devices, wireless connectivity, cloud platforms, and enterprise software into scalable, production-ready solutions. This includes IoT platforms, AI-enabled video analytics, robotics systems, and cloud-based software solutions deployed on platforms such as AWS and GCP.
Across these industries, my focus has consistently been on designing solutions that are operationally robust, secure, and suitable for large-scale or mission-critical environments.
Describe a complex end-to-end solution you designed from concept to implementation handover.
It would be the Boston Dynamic SPOT robotic dog project that I designed end to end solution from the SPOT dog hardware equipment, transferring of data over the air, receiving the data in the cloud, the enterprise software receiving the data, the software issuing command and control over the air back to the spot robot.
Here is the final delivery of the robotic dog. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DJmIjKtVkA

How do you translate business requirements into technical architecture and delivery plans?
I start by clearly understanding the business outcome before touching the technology. This means clarifying the problem statement, success criteria, constraints such as budget, timeline, security, and operational requirements, and who the stakeholders are.
I then translate these into high-level functional and non-functional requirements — for example performance, availability, security, compliance, and scalability. From there, I design a solution architecture that maps each business requirement to specific system components, integrations, and responsibilities across vendors or platforms.
Once the architecture is clear, I break it down into delivery phases. This includes defining the scope for POCs if required, identifying integration points and risks, validating assumptions with engineering teams, and aligning with vendors or partners on feasibility and timelines.
I work closely with sales, project, and engineering teams to convert the architecture into a delivery plan — covering implementation approach, milestones, dependencies, testing, acceptance criteria, and handover to operations. Throughout the process, I ensure alignment with security, governance, and quality standards.
Finally, I keep the solution practical and buildable by continuously validating it with delivery teams and customers, so what is proposed can be implemented smoothly and meets the original business objectives.
What architecture standards or governance frameworks have you implemented?
One good example is the Boston Dynamics SPOT robotic dog project, which I led from solution concept through to implementation handover.
The objective was to deploy a robotic solution for remote monitoring and enforcement use cases, under tight timelines and operational constraints. I designed the end-to-end architecture, covering the SPOT hardware platform, wireless data transmission, cloud ingestion, and the enterprise software layer.
This included defining how sensor and video data was transmitted over the air to the cloud, processed and visualised by enterprise applications, and how command-and-control instructions were securely issued back to the robot in near real time. I worked closely with vendors, engineering teams, and stakeholders to validate feasibility, manage integration risks, and ensure the solution was operationally ready.
The solution was successfully deployed and handed over for operational use, demonstrating a fully integrated robotics, connectivity, cloud, and software system in a real-world environment.
The final deployment can be seen in this public video. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DJmIjKtVkA
Can you share an example where you improved system performance, scalability, or reliability?
One example was during my time at GovTech, working on large-scale IoT platforms where video analytics performance and scalability were critical. I identified that system performance was being constrained by inefficient resource utilisation across the network and application layers.
I redesigned key parts of the architecture to optimise how video frames were processed for identification, improving traffic handling and streamlining data processing flows. This significantly increased system throughput and stability under peak load, while enabling the platform to scale more predictably as usage grew.
In another cloud-based IoT platform, I improved reliability by introducing a clearer separation between data ingestion, processing, and command-and-control components. This reduced cascading failures, simplified recovery, and made the system easier to operate. I also modularised core functions so they could scale independently as demand increased.
Across these initiatives, the focus was on improving performance and scalability while ensuring the solutions remained resilient, supportable, and suitable for long-term operations.
How do you approach R&D initiatives or proof-of-concepts (POCs)?
I approach R&D and POCs with a problem-first, outcome-driven mindset, rather than adopting technology for its own sake. For me, technology is an enabler to achieve reliable and scalable project delivery.
I start by clearly defining the business or operational requirements, success criteria, and constraints such as cost, timeline, security, and integration with existing systems. From there, I design a small, focused POC to validate the most critical assumptions early — whether related to performance, accuracy, scalability, or feasibility.
In enterprise and public-sector environments, I pay close attention to security, compliance, and operational fit even at the POC stage, so that successful POCs can realistically transition into production. I also document outcomes clearly, including limitations and risks, to help stakeholders make informed decisions based on evidence rather than optimism.
Which emerging technologies do you actively track and why?
I actively track emerging technologies that have practical enterprise impact, especially those relevant to digital transformation and operational efficiency. These include:
AI/ML at the edge (computer vision, inference optimisation) for use cases like surveillance, inspection, and automation
Cloud-native and hybrid architectures, particularly containerisation (Docker, Kubernetes) and microservices, to support scalability and resilience
IoT platforms and data pipelines, including event-driven architectures (APIs) for real-time processing
Security and governance technologies, especially around identity, zero trust, and data protection
I focus less on hype and more on technologies that can realistically be adopted in regulated, cost-conscious enterprise environments.
What is your role in tenders, RFPs, RFQs, or RFIs?
My role typically spans both technical leadership and solution ownership.
I work closely with sales and commercial teams to:
Interpret customer requirements and clarify ambiguities
Design and demonstrate relevant proofs of concept where needed
Shape the overall solution architecture, including assumptions and constraints
Contribute to technical write-ups, diagrams, compliance matrices, and responses
Support pricing discussions by aligning architectural decisions with cost drivers
For more complex tenders, I also engage customers early through clarification sessions or technical briefings to reduce misalignment and risk.
How do you identify and manage technical or commercial risks during the proposal stage?
I identify risks by reviewing requirements, assumptions, dependencies, and integration points early in the proposal stage.
On the technical side, I look for:
Unproven technologies or aggressive performance requirements
Integration with legacy or third-party systems
Scalability, operability, or support limitations
On the commercial side, I assess:
Ambiguous or incomplete requirements
Aggressive timelines
Misalignment between customer expectations and budget
I manage these risks by surfacing them early, proposing mitigation strategies, and documenting assumptions clearly in the proposal. Where appropriate, I recommend phased delivery or optional items to protect both the customer and the organisation.
Describe a time you led a technical presentation or solution briefing for a client.
I have led multiple technical presentations and solution briefings across organisations such as Motorola, Singtel, GovTech, and startups, where my role was to translate complex architectures into clear, objective-driven narratives.
I typically structure these sessions around:
The customer’s problem and objectives
The proposed architecture and key design decisions
Trade-offs, risks, and why specific options were selected
I adjust the depth based on the audience — focusing on outcomes and risks for management, and going deeper into architecture and integration details with technical teams. My goal is to build confidence and trust, not just to impress technically.
How do you manage differing expectations between sales, clients, and delivery teams?
I act as a bridge between sales, clients, and delivery teams.
I make expectations explicit early, especially around scope, timelines, and non-functional requirements. When conflicts arise, I focus discussions on facts, constraints, and trade-offs, rather than opinions.
By documenting decisions clearly and involving delivery teams early in solution shaping, I help reduce last-minute surprises, scope creep, and rework.
What is your leadership style when mentoring engineers or architects?
My leadership style is hands-on with strong technical reasoning, while remaining supportive.
I focus on:
Guiding engineers to think in terms of design approaches and trade-offs, not just implementation
Encouraging clear documentation and structured thinking
Creating an open environment for discussion, questions, and learning
Rather than micromanaging, I aim to enable autonomy, while remaining available for review, feedback, and escalation when needed.
How do you identify upsell or cross-sell opportunities while delivering solutions?
I identify opportunities by understanding the customer’s operational challenges, internal processes, legacy constraints, and future roadmap.
During delivery, I look for gaps such as:
Manual processes that could be automated
Legacy systems or resource constraints that limit scalability or efficiency
Additional analytics, security, or optimisation needs
I raise these as value-based recommendations, not sales pushes, and work with sales teams to position them appropriately.
How do you ensure a smooth transition from pre-sales to project execution?
I ensure continuity by providing clear and detailed technical documentation during handover.
This includes:
Architecture diagrams and design rationale
Key assumptions, trade-offs, and known risks
Open issues and dependencies
I also stay involved during the early delivery phase to support clarification and prevent design drift.
In your view, what defines success for a Solutions Architect in the first 6–12 months?
Success means:
Building credibility and trust with customers, sales, and delivery teams
Delivering solutions that are technically sound and commercially viable
Reducing friction between pre-sales and delivery
Contributing to repeat business or expanded engagements
Ultimately, a successful Solutions Architect is someone stakeholders actively want involved in complex and strategic opportunities.
16. What tools you using to source leads and to do Solution architect?
For solution architecture and delivery, I commonly use:
Architecture and diagramming tools (e.g. Visio)
Cloud and platform reference architectures (e.g. AWS reference architectures)
Documentation tools (Confluence, Word, PowerPoint)
For lead sourcing, I typically work through sales-driven channels, such as CRM systems, partner ecosystems, and existing client relationships, rather than direct outbound prospecting.

Dear Sir/Madam,

I processed excellent communication, listening and interpretation skill, customer engagement, negotiation, team working, senior level management and proactive in whatever I do. I can lead in multi-organization (virtual team management) in both internal and external environments and remote locations.
I have lot of experience in implementing smart cities project, and lot of challenges and costly mistake can be avoided. By joining your organization, I can bring my experience in IoT, 4G, 5G, CCTV, IoT Platform, video management platform, Virtual Reality visualization, Robotic automation, Video analytic, Biometric (face recognition, gait recognition, human detection) to your organization. I consider myself as a Technologies Evangelist and have great instinct in targeting technologies with high potential to make it big in international arena. I am able to pick up new technologies quickly and speak like an expert, eg I have implemented Virtual Reality dashboard for Lamppost as a Platform within a short time frame of 3 months. 
I have gained a lot from the evaluation of these projects,
List of projects I have participated,
Successfully implemented Virtual Reality POC, which include content creation in Geospatial system, 3D modelling, computer vision for Smart Nation project 
https://drive.google.com/open?id=1aQStEhIZ47QWRkNjG-StNIP75Fck7Lwg
Achieved trial of Boston Dynamics SPOT in Bishan-AMK park for safe distance during Circuit Breaker within limited time. https://youtu.be/2DJmIjKtVkAEt

Smart lamppost nationwide project in One North and Geylang 
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/smart-lampposts-singapore-wont-shine-light-peoples-lives-10229804
I have 23 years rare wireless experience, and it will greatly help in 5G which is an upcoming technology where other technologies will leverage on. This is an area where Singapore is in short supply.
I can help form a relevant team to oversee the technology space and coach them with my valuable experience in smart technology. As new technology is a fast moving space, I always keep up to the latest technologies.
In addition to these experiences, I graduated with MBA, major in Strategy, Finance, and Accounting, and BEng (1st Class) in Electronic Engineering. I also bring to the table strong computer proficiencies in MS Word, MS Excel. Please see the accompanying resume for details of my experience and education.
I am confident that I can offer you the stakeholder management, communication, customer facing and problem-solving skills you are seeking. Thank you for your time. I look forward to learning more about this opportunity!

Dear Sir/Madam,

I have gone through a lot of experience in implementing nationwide smart project, and lot of challenges and costly mistake can be avoided. By joining your organization. I can bring my experience in IoT, 4G, 5G, Virtual Reality visualization, Robotic automation, Video analytic, biometric (face recognition, gait recognition, human detection) to your organization. GovTech is a pioneer in a lot of these technologies trial, POC, and deployment, thus I have gain insight into the unknown territory. New organization will have to trial before it can be uncovered, but with my ample knowledge of these issues, a lot of waste effort can be prevented.
I had trial, POC, evaluated a lot of smart projects and have gained a lot of insight what work for the benefit of the citizens. I have gained a lot from the evaluation of these projects. This experience would help your organization in cost saving then trialing the same technology and implementation.

1️⃣ HOW THIS INTERVIEW WILL BE STRUCTURED (REALISTIC)
Expect 2–3 interviewers, usually:
Hiring Manager / Architecture Lead
BU or Delivery Lead
Possibly a senior architect or programme manager
They will assess you on 4 dimensions:
Solution architecture depth
Government / WOG experience
Client & stakeholder management
Delivery under complexity
They are not testing coding.

2️⃣ OPENING QUESTION (ALMOST GUARANTEED)
❓ “Can you walk us through your background?”
✅ Perfect Answer (2 minutes – practise this)
“I’m a solution architect by training and practice, with over 20 years of experience delivering enterprise-grade and mission-critical systems across government, defence, public safety, and regulated environments.
In Singapore, my most relevant experience was at GovTech, where I led Whole-of-Government solution architecture initiatives spanning cloud platforms, AI-enabled systems, and multi-agency integrations. I worked directly with senior government stakeholders, shaped national technology adoption strategies, and governed the design and delivery of systems deployed at national scale.
Prior to that, I was in senior solution architect roles with Motorola Solutions and Alcatel-Lucent, where I worked closely with OEM product teams and government customers to design secure, mission-critical platforms.
Across my roles, I’ve consistently operated at the intersection of architecture leadership, client engagement, and delivery — ensuring solutions are technically sound, aligned to government frameworks, and actually usable by agencies. That combination is what attracted me to this Solution Architect role at ST Engineering.”
🧠 What they hear:
✔ Senior
✔ Government-ready
✔ Client-facing
✔ Architect + delivery

3️⃣ CLIENT MANAGEMENT (THIS IS CRITICAL)
❓ “This role is very client-facing. How do you manage government stakeholders?”
✅ Strong Answer (USE THIS STRUCTURE)
“I approach client management as a trust-building exercise rather than a transactional one. With government stakeholders, clarity, predictability, and credibility are critical.
I typically start by understanding the agency’s policy intent and operational constraints before proposing any technical solution. I spend time aligning expectations early — what the solution will do, what it will not do, and the trade-offs involved.
At GovTech, I regularly engaged senior leaders across multiple agencies, chaired technical discussions, and translated complex architecture decisions into language that policy, ops, and procurement teams could align on.
When issues arise — which they always do in complex programmes — I address them transparently, present options with risks clearly articulated, and guide stakeholders toward informed decisions. This approach has allowed me to maintain strong working relationships while still holding firm on architectural integrity.”
🧠 What they hear:
✔ Mature
✔ Calm under pressure
✔ Trusted advisor
✔ Not defensive or salesy

4️⃣ SOLUTION ARCHITECTURE DEPTH
❓ “How do you approach designing enterprise-grade solutions?”
✅ Model Answer
“I start from the problem and operating context, not the technology. For government systems, that includes security frameworks, data sensitivity, inter-agency integration, and long-term maintainability.
Architecturally, I focus on modularity, reuse, and clear separation of concerns — so platforms can evolve without rework. I define integration patterns early, align on data ownership, and ensure security is built into the design rather than added later.
I also put strong emphasis on deployment and operations. A solution is not successful until it is stable in production, supported by clear runbooks and ownership. Throughout my career, I’ve been involved from architecture design through go-live and handover, which helps me design solutions that actually work in the real world.”

5️⃣ MULTI-AGENCY & COMPLEX PROGRAMMES
❓ “Tell us about a complex multi-agency project you handled.”
✅ Use GovTech Example
“One example was the design and deployment of a cloud-based government IoT and analytics platform that involved multiple agencies with different operational needs and security concerns.
My role was to lead the solution architecture, align agencies on a common platform approach, and govern vendor delivery. This required balancing standardisation with agency-specific requirements.
I facilitated architecture workshops, resolved integration concerns, and ensured that the platform met government cloud and security requirements. The system was deployed successfully and later extended with AI-enabled use cases, demonstrating its scalability and reusability.”

6️⃣ OEM & PARTNER MANAGEMENT
❓ “How do you work with OEMs like ServiceNow, cloud providers, or platform vendors?”
✅ Model Answer
“I see OEMs as partners, but I’m clear that the architecture must serve the client’s long-term interests, not vendor lock-in.
In my roles at Motorola Solutions and Alcatel-Lucent, I worked closely with OEM product and R&D teams to shape roadmaps and close architectural gaps for government deployments.
I ensure expectations are set early — architecture standards, security requirements, and delivery responsibilities. When issues arise, I engage vendors constructively but firmly, using facts and architectural principles rather than escalation by authority.
This approach has allowed me to maintain strong vendor relationships while ensuring solutions remain compliant, scalable, and aligned to government needs.”

7️⃣ DELIVERY & ESCALATIONS
❓ “How do you handle technical escalations or delivery issues?”
✅ Strong Answer
“I focus on resolving issues quickly while keeping stakeholders informed. When an escalation happens, I first stabilise the situation — understand the root cause, assess impact, and identify viable options.
I then communicate clearly with stakeholders, outlining options, risks, and recommended actions. I avoid technical jargon unless necessary and focus on outcomes.
Because I’m involved in both architecture and delivery, I’m often able to bridge gaps between engineering teams and clients, which helps de-escalate situations before they become critical.”

8️⃣ WHY ST ENGINEERING
❓ “Why are you interested in ST Engineering?”
✅ Use This (Very Important)
“ST Engineering sits at the intersection of technology, government, and mission-critical systems, which aligns very closely with my background.
The Mission Software & Services business, in particular, focuses on enterprise platforms, secure systems integration, and AI-enabled decision support — areas where I’ve delivered at national scale.
I’m motivated by work that has real impact, and I see this role as an opportunity to contribute my experience in Whole-of-Government architecture and client engagement to support Singapore’s digital government vision.”

9️⃣ CLOSING QUESTION (THEIR LAST IMPRESSION)
❓ “Do you have any questions for us?”
✅ Ask ONE of these:
“What does success look like for this role in the first 12 months?”
or
“What are the biggest challenges your government clients are facing today that you would like this role to help address?”
This signals ownership and client focus.



1. Focus on Security (IT/OT, Critical Infrastructure)
Q: ST Engineering works extensively with critical infrastructure. How do you approach end-to-end IT/OT cybersecurity?
Model Answer (Practise Version):
I approach IT/OT security from an operational risk perspective rather than a purely technical one. In critical infrastructure, availability and safety are just as important as confidentiality.
My first step is to understand what systems are truly mission-critical and what a failure would mean operationally—whether that’s public safety, service downtime, or regulatory exposure. I then design segmented architectures with clear trust boundaries between IT and OT, applying principles such as network zoning, least privilege access, and continuous monitoring.
I’ve found that security only works if it’s operationally realistic. I work closely with operations teams to ensure controls don’t disrupt day-to-day execution, while still meeting security and compliance requirements.

Q: How do you deal with operations teams who feel security slows them down?
Model Answer:
I translate security into business and operational impact. Instead of saying “this is required,” I explain realistic threat scenarios and the consequences if controls are missing.
I usually present options with different risk and cost trade-offs, so leadership can make informed decisions. This approach turns security from a blocker into a shared responsibility, and over time it builds trust with operations teams.

2. Smart City, 5G-in-a-Box, Autonomous Systems, Digital Twins
Q: What is your understanding of Smart City initiatives like 5G-in-a-Box and digital twins?
Model Answer:
I see Smart City initiatives as integrated platforms rather than isolated technologies.
5G-in-a-Box enables secure, low-latency edge connectivity that supports real-time use cases such as video analytics, autonomous systems, and sensor-driven operations. Digital twins then sit on top of these platforms, providing a live operational view of physical assets for simulation, predictive maintenance, and decision support.
From my experience, the real value comes when connectivity, data, analytics, and operations are designed together as one architecture.

Q: How do you ensure these initiatives don’t stay as pilots?
Model Answer:
I always anchor initiatives to a clear operational problem and measurable KPIs.
I typically recommend phased deployment—prove value in a controlled environment, validate outcomes, then scale. This reduces risk, builds stakeholder confidence, and ensures technology adoption is driven by outcomes, not novelty.

3. TOGAF & Enterprise Architecture
Q: How familiar are you with TOGAF, and how do you apply it?
Model Answer:
I use TOGAF as a guiding framework rather than a rigid process. It helps structure conversations around current state, target state, and transition roadmaps.
In practice, I focus on aligning business objectives with application, data, technology, and security layers, while being realistic about operational constraints. This is especially important in multi-agency and multi-vendor environments, which I’ve worked extensively in.

Q: How do you balance architecture governance with delivery speed?
Model Answer:
I believe in lightweight, pragmatic governance. Clear standards, reusable reference architectures, and early engagement actually speed up delivery by reducing rework.
My goal is to enable teams to move faster with clarity, not slow them down with excessive documentation.

4. Vibe Check (Fit, Communication, Stress)
Q: This role is very client-facing. How do you manage clients and stakeholders?
Model Answer:
I focus on trust, clarity, and consistency. Clients appreciate that I listen carefully, ask the right questions, and explain complex technical issues in business terms.
I’m comfortable engaging senior stakeholders and guiding discussions toward decisions, especially when there are competing priorities. This has been a big part of my roles in government, public safety, and regulated environments.

Q: How do you handle pressure or ambiguous situations?
Model Answer:
I stay calm and structured. In high-pressure situations, I break problems down, prioritise decisions, and communicate frequently.
I’ve worked on mission-critical systems and time-sensitive deployments, including national-level initiatives, so I’m used to making clear decisions under uncertainty while keeping teams aligned.

Q: Why ST Engineering?
Model Answer:
ST Engineering operates in environments where reliability, security, and real-world impact matter. My background in critical infrastructure, government systems, and large-scale platforms aligns strongly with that mission.
I’m motivated by roles where technology directly supports operations, safety, and long-term sustainability, and where strong client engagement is essential to success.

🔹 Key Government Frameworks You Should Know
1️⃣ Government on Commercial Cloud (GCC)
What it is:
A platform to standardise and secure how government agencies adopt commercial cloud services (AWS, Azure, GCP) for hosting systems and delivering digital services. 
Why it matters:
Provides common cloud infrastructure with built-in security, observability, compliance automation, and auditability. 
Supports a large portion of WOG systems and encourages modern application development practices. 
Onboarding is streamlined and aligned to cloud-native capabilities plus security policy-as-code (continuous compliance). 
What this means for frontend/backend stacks:
Your applications are expected to run on GCC, using cloud services (compute, storage, databases) with strong integrated security and monitoring. 
Standardised tooling (like containerisation, CI/CD pipelines, observability stacks) helps backend services deliver secure APIs and data integration. 
For frontend, shared components and design systems (e.g., SGDS) ensure consistent citizen UX, often hosted in secure cloud environments under GCC. 

2️⃣ Government Zero Trust Architecture (GovZTA)
What it is:
Singapore’s Zero Trust cybersecurity model tailored for the public sector, emphasising “never trust, always verify” across identities, devices, networks, applications, and data. 
Key principles:
Least privilege access and continuous authentication. 
No implicit trust, whether inside or outside the network perimeter. 
Dynamic risk-based policies, strong identity controls, and automated detection/response. 
What this means for solutions:
Every service (frontend or backend) must authenticate and validate requests at every boundary. 
DevOps, API gateways, IAM, and microsegmentation are typically used together to enforce Zero Trust. 
You can position Zero Trust as an architecture baseline for secure platform design, especially for cloud-native government solutions.

3️⃣ IM8 (Instruction Manual for ICT & Smart Systems)
What it is:
The foundational security and governance policy framework for all public sector IT systems, formerly known as IM8, setting baseline controls for ICT & SS risk management. 
Core objectives:
Standardised security hygiene and governance for government systems. 
Risk-based controls for access management, logging, monitoring, data handling, and third-party integrations. 
Differentiated treatment based on system risk/classification. 
How it connects to GCC & Zero Trust:
GCC infrastructure often needs to be IM8 compliant — meaning baseline controls and monitoring are enforced. 
Zero Trust practices (GovZTA) can be viewed as a logical evolution of IM8 security controls for cloud and modern application stacks. 

📌 How These Frameworks Relate to Typical SG Government Tech Stacks
Frontend UX: Built with standards like Government Design System (SGDS) – ensures consistent, accessible interfaces. 
Backend services: Deployed on GCC cloud platforms, tied to identity services (Singpass, Corppass), security logging, and Zero Trust request validation. 
APIs: Often served through secure gateways (e.g., APEX), with authentication and continuous verification. 
Data services: Need strong classification, encryption, and monitoring following IM8 policies. 

🧠 Model Interview Answers You Can Use
❓ “Can you explain how you would align a solution with Singapore’s digital government frameworks like GCC, Zero Trust, and IM8?”
Model Answer:
“To align with Singapore’s digital government frameworks, I take a layered and policy-aware approach. First, I ensure the solution is architected for the Government on Commercial Cloud (GCC) platform — using cloud-native services with built-in security controls and monitoring, and following the standardised tooling and CI/CD practices that GCC promotes for WOG adoption. 
Second, I embed Zero Trust principles throughout — meaning every request, identity, and device is continuously verified, access is least-privileged, and authentication is enforced at every boundary. This significantly strengthens security for both frontend and backend interactions. 
Finally, I ensure compliance with IM8 security and governance policies, which provide the baseline security controls for agency ICT systems. This includes secure access, logging, monitoring, and data protection. I see Zero Trust as complementing IM8 controls, elevating them in a cloud and API-centric environment. 
Together, these frameworks ensure the solution is secure, compliant, and scalable for government use.”

❓ “How would you ensure this compliance applies to both frontend and backend components?”
Model Answer:
“For a frontend, compliance would mean using components and design systems aligned to government standards, enforcing identity-based access via secure tokens, and ensuring HTTPS endpoints with logging and monitoring from the outset. On the backend, I would enforce Zero Trust access policies, API gateway controls, and service-to-service authentication. All services must emit logs, adhere to security controls defined in IM8, and leverage GCC’s native monitoring and compliance features for auditability. ”

🧠 Extra Tip for Interview
Even if you’re not fully deep on the exact policy language, you can show understanding by speaking in terms of security principles and operational impact:
“Where I have not directly implemented IM8 or GovZTA policies, I translate them into their **core principles – secure by design, continuous verification, governance and compliance alignment, and observability — and ensure the solution meets these outcomes in an enterprise and cloud-native context.”

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to express my interest in the Vice President, New Product Development position at SATS. With more than 23 years of experience driving innovation, leading cross-functional engineering teams, and transforming complex technology ecosystems across government, telecommunications, and global enterprises, I bring a strong track record of designing, piloting, and launching new products and services that deliver operational excellence and high customer value.

Across my career at GovTech, Singtel, Motorola, and Alcatel-Lucent, I have consistently led end-to-end product innovation—from ideation and qualification to piloting, scaling, and launch. At the Government Technology Agency, I spearheaded Whole-of-Government innovation initiatives, scanning and applying new technologies such as IoT, 5G, data analytics, VR, and AI/ML to redesign existing processes and create new capabilities. I successfully delivered multiple proofs-of-concept, including the SPOT robotic platform deployment and VR geospatial system, integrating advanced technologies into real operating environments and maturing them into viable solutions. These initiatives required a structured innovation framework, stakeholder alignment, rapid experimentation, and rigorous evaluation—directly aligned with the product development lifecycle at SATS.

My earlier roles in Singtel and Motorola strengthened my leadership in solution design, program management, and market-driven product development. At Singtel, I established multiple Centres of Excellence for emerging wireless technologies, collaborating with international partners such as Airtel, AIS, Globe, and Telkomsel. I led ideation and qualification of new solutions, built strategic roadmaps, and delivered technology adoption programs that generated over US$100 million in savings. This experience honed my capability to translate customer insights, competitive intelligence, and operational constraints into differentiated offerings—skills essential for expanding SATS’ addressable market across airline, logistics, and e-commerce sectors.

Throughout my career, I have also demonstrated strong governance and program leadership. I led multi-year, multi-stakeholder engineering programs, managed globally distributed teams, coordinated with R&D leadership in the US and Europe, and delivered mission-critical systems for operators such as AT&T, Orange, NTT Docomo, and Telenor. I am deeply familiar with agile development, technology maturation, process re-engineering, and building frameworks that improve the success rate of new product initiatives.

I am particularly drawn to SATS’ commitment to FAM—creating fulfilling, appreciated, and meaningful careers. As a leader, I prioritize building high-performing, empowered teams, and cultivating a culture of continuous improvement, ownership, and innovation. I believe that collaborative environments produce the most successful products, and I have consistently fostered such cultures across my previous organisations.

I am excited about the opportunity to contribute my expertise in product innovation, digital technologies, and solution design to build new service offerings that differentiate SATS in a rapidly evolving global supply chain landscape. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background in product leadership, innovation frameworks, stakeholder engagement, and scaling new technologies can support SATS’ long-term commercial and strategic ambitions.
Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Freddy Goh

In my previous role, I faced challenges related to collaboration and team alignment. Several key projects required joint ownership, but due to differing working styles and expectations between my manager and myself, I often ended up handling significant portions of the work alone. This created constraints that affected overall project performance.
I take responsibility for my part in the outcome, and the experience has taught me the importance of proactively clarifying roles, expectations, and communication channels early in a project. It also strengthened my commitment to maintaining strong stakeholder relationships and ensuring alignment from the start.
While it was a difficult situation, it helped me grow professionally, and I am now much more attentive to establishing the right collaboration structures to ensure project success.

Dear Kah Fai,

Thank you again for arranging the discussion with the panel.

I would appreciate it if you could convey the following to Russell and Nicholas: I genuinely enjoyed the conversation and found it very engaging. The discussion resonated strongly with my own experience working closely with internal stakeholders across regions—both locally and overseas—through my time at Motorola, Singtel, and Nokia Bell Labs. Those experiences have reinforced the importance of collaboration and alignment when delivering complex, cross-functional initiatives, particularly in technology-driven environments.

The exchange further strengthened my interest in the role and how I could contribute at the intersection of people, process, and AI delivery.
I would also appreciate your guidance on the next steps and indicative timeline when convenient.

Thank you again, and I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,
Freddy Goh

INTERVIEWER INTENT (VERY IMPORTANT)
🧠 Russell Ngo – Senior Director, Regulatory Engineering
He will test:
Judgment
Risk thinking
Program ownership
“Will this guy protect the company?”
Expect WHY + WHAT IF questions.
🧠 Nicholas Wong – Senior Principal Engineer (Regulatory)
He will test:
Technical depth (without coding)
AI failure modes
Data correctness
System boundaries
Expect HOW + EDGE CASE questions.

PART 2 — PREDICTED QUESTIONS + MODEL ANSWERS (PRACTICE-READY)

QUESTION 1 (Russell – almost guaranteed)
“Tell us about a complex AI or technology program you managed end-to-end.”
MODEL ANSWER (STAR – Boston Dynamics)
Situation
“At Singtel, I was involved in deploying AI-enabled autonomous robotics using Boston Dynamics Spot as part of operational monitoring and inspection use cases, where safety, accuracy, and reliability were critical.”
Task
“My responsibility was to run the technical program end-to-end — aligning AI perception, data capture, operational workflows, and stakeholders — while ensuring the system behaved safely in real environments.”
Action
“I broke the program into clear layers:
what the AI could detect,
what it could recommend,
and what required human approval.
We implemented human-in-the-loop controls, staged rollouts, and clear acceptance criteria. Delivery was Agile, but with additional checkpoints because mistakes in physical environments are costly.”
Result
“We deployed successfully into production use, reduced manual inspection effort, and created a reusable governance model for future AI initiatives.”
Anchor line (pause after this):
“That experience shaped how I manage AI programs — delivery speed matters, but control and accountability matter more.”

QUESTION 2 (Nicholas – very likely)
“How would you approach building an AI chatbot on private regulatory data?”
MODEL ANSWER (STRUCTURED – NOT TOO TECHNICAL)
“I would treat this as a regulated AI system, not a general chatbot.”
1️⃣ Scope & boundaries first
Clearly define what the chatbot can answer and must not answer
Escalation rules for ambiguous or high-risk queries
2️⃣ Data governance
Private regulatory database as read-only source of truth
Versioned content, clear ownership
Every response traceable to a specific clause or document
3️⃣ AI behavior control
Use retrieval-based architecture rather than free generation
Mandatory citation with every answer
Confidence scoring or ‘unable to answer’ responses
4️⃣ Validation & delivery
SME-reviewed test cases
Sprint acceptance criteria include correctness and traceability, not just functionality
Anchor line:
“In regulatory environments, an AI that refuses to answer is safer than one that guesses.”

QUESTION 3 (Russell – leadership + scale)
“Tell us about a time you delivered significant business impact.”
MODEL ANSWER (STAR – SGD 100M cost savings)
Situation
“At Singtel, operational costs were increasing due to scale and manual processes.”
Task
“I was responsible for driving technology-led initiatives to reduce cost while maintaining service reliability.”
Action
“We identified areas suitable for automation and AI-assisted decisioning, prioritised initiatives based on ROI and risk, and rolled them out incrementally with measurable KPIs.”
Result
“These initiatives delivered cumulative cost savings in excess of SGD 100 million, while improving operational visibility and response times.”
Anchor line:
“The key was disciplined execution — no shortcuts that would introduce operational or compliance risk.”

QUESTION 4 (Nicholas – failure mode)
“What happens if the AI gives a wrong regulatory answer?”
MODEL ANSWER (THIS WILL IMPRESS THEM)
“If that happens, it’s not an AI problem — it’s a system design failure.”
Then continue calmly:
Responses must always reference source material
Confidence scoring and ‘no-answer’ thresholds
Human escalation paths
Full audit logs of queries and responses
Anchor line:
“For regulatory AI, explainability and auditability are more important than cleverness.”

QUESTION 5 (Russell – stakeholder conflict)
“How do you handle disagreement between engineers and regulatory stakeholders?”
MODEL ANSWER
“I classify disagreements into three categories:
technical feasibility
regulatory risk
delivery sequencing
If it’s regulatory risk, compliance has the final say.
If it’s technical, we prototype or test.
If it’s delivery, I phase the rollout.”
Anchor line:
“In regulated environments, consensus matters more than speed.”

QUESTION 6 (Nicholas – hands-on depth check)
“How hands-on do you need to be with AI?”
MODEL ANSWER
“I don’t position myself as the primary coder, but I’m hands-on enough to understand failure modes, constraints, and trade-offs. That allows me to ask the right questions and unblock teams quickly.”
Anchor line:
“My value is ensuring engineers can move fast without putting the organisation at risk.”

PART 3 — HOW TO POSITION YOURSELF (MEMORISE THIS)
If you say one thing only, make it this:
“My strength is running AI programs in environments where mistakes are expensive — regulatory, operational, or reputational.”
That sentence fits this role perfectly.

FINAL INTERVIEW TACTICS (DO THIS)
Speak slower than normal
Pause after anchor lines
Don’t oversell “chatbot experience”
Emphasise judgement, structure, governance
Ask one closing question:
👉
“What would success look like for this AI program in its first 12 months?”
That’s a Senior Director–level close.
1️⃣ “HOW would you run this program?” (Operating model questions)
These are scenario / design questions, not behavioural.
Likely questions
“How would you structure delivery if the team is spread across regions?”
“How do you maintain control without micromanaging?”
“How do you ensure regulatory consistency globally?”
What they are really testing
Can you operate at scale
Can you handle time zones + governance
Are you a safe pair of hands
Model framing (you can reuse this structure)
“I usually run distributed AI programs with three layers…”
Model answer
“I use a three-layer operating model:
Central governance – standards, decision rights, regulatory interpretation
Regional execution – engineering and data teams deliver locally
Clear escalation paths – for regulatory ambiguity or AI failure modes
This allows autonomy without fragmentation.”
Anchor line:
“Distributed teams work best when decision rights are explicit.”

2️⃣ “WHAT would you do if…?” (Judgment & escalation)
These are stress tests, not trick questions.
Likely questions
“What if regions interpret regulations differently?”
“What if AI output conflicts with a regulatory expert’s opinion?”
“What if engineering wants speed but compliance wants certainty?”
What they are testing
Judgment under ambiguity
Respect for regulatory authority
Risk prioritisation
Model answer pattern
“First clarify the risk category, then decide who owns the decision.”
Example:
“If there’s a regulatory disagreement, I pause delivery on that scope, document both interpretations, and escalate to the designated regulatory authority. AI output never overrides human regulatory judgment.”
Anchor line:
“AI informs decisions — it doesn’t make them.”

3️⃣ AI GOVERNANCE & CONTROL (Very likely)
Because this is private regulatory data, they will go here.
Likely questions
“How do you prevent hallucinations?”
“How do you control scope creep?”
“How do you audit AI decisions?”
What they want to hear
You don’t treat AI like a toy
You design guardrails first
Model answer snippet
“I define success for regulatory AI as:
Traceable
Explainable
Auditable
Able to say ‘I don’t know’”
Anchor line:
“Accuracy beats coverage in regulatory systems.”

4️⃣ STAKEHOLDER POWER DYNAMICS (Very Dell)
This is subtle but important.
Likely questions
“How do you work with senior regulatory experts?”
“How do you challenge without overstepping?”
What they are testing
Maturity
Respect for expertise
Influence without authority
Model answer
“I don’t challenge regulatory experts on interpretation. I challenge on assumptions, data freshness, and operational impact — and I do it with evidence.”
Anchor line:
“Respect the role, not just the title.”

5️⃣ DELIVERY METRICS (Often overlooked by candidates)
Likely questions
“How do you measure success for this AI program?”
“What KPIs would you track?”
Strong answer (keep it simple)
“I’d track:
Response accuracy (validated by SMEs)
Escalation rate to humans
Time saved per regulatory query
Number of prevented incorrect actions”
Anchor line:
“If we can’t measure safety, we can’t scale.”

6️⃣ CULTURE & FIT (Quiet but real)
Dell cares a lot about:
Structured thinking
Calm communication
No heroics
Likely soft questions
“How do you handle ambiguity?”
“How do you work when requirements aren’t clear?”
Model answer
“I’m comfortable starting with incomplete information, as long as decision rights and escalation paths are clear.”
Anchor line:
“Clarity is something you create, not wait for.”

Across my career, I’ve often worked at the intersection of complex technology, real-world constraints, and teams that don’t naturally speak the same language.
One example was a programme I led involving AI-enabled robotic platforms — similar to Boston Dynamics’ robotic dogs — used in environments where human access was limited. The technology itself was challenging, but the harder part was aligning AI engineers, platform vendors, and operational stakeholders around how the system should behave, what information it should trust, and how people should respond when the AI was uncertain. My role was to structure the work so assumptions were made explicit, tasks were clearly owned, and decisions were documented early, so teams could move forward with confidence instead of re-debating fundamentals each sprint.
Earlier at Singtel, I led large regional programmes across multiple countries where small architectural decisions had massive cost implications. By getting engineering, vendors, and business teams aligned on common standards and execution sequencing, we avoided duplication and inefficiencies, ultimately delivering over US$100 million in cost savings. That outcome wasn’t about technical brilliance — it came from getting the right people aligned around shared data, shared decisions, and a clear delivery framework.
What connects these experiences is my focus on enabling experts to do their best work. I don’t try to out-engineer engineers or out-specialise domain experts. Instead, I help translate their knowledge into structured systems, processes, and delivery plans — whether that’s an AI-enabled platform or, in this case, an internal AI knowledge system that can reliably answer questions based on complex, evolving information.
That’s the role I see myself playing here: helping your regulatory and engineering experts collaborate effectively, so their knowledge can be harnessed into an AI system that is useful, trusted, and sustainable.”

“It’s the same problem — turning expert knowledge that lives across people and tools into a system others can rely on, without losing nuance or trust.
“Can you walk us through a relevant project you’ve led?”
What they’re really asking
Can you run something complex, ambiguous, and people-heavy without trying to be the smartest person in the room?
Model Answer
“Two experiences stand out.
First, I led an AI-enabled robotics programme where the challenge wasn’t the technology itself, but aligning engineers, vendors, and operational stakeholders on how the system should behave and how much trust to place in the outputs. My role was to structure the work so assumptions were explicit, responsibilities were clear, and decisions were captured early — allowing teams to move forward without repeatedly revisiting fundamentals.
Earlier at Singtel, I ran large multi-country programmes where different teams had deep expertise but operated in silos. By aligning them around shared standards, shared data, and a common delivery framework, we avoided duplication and inefficiencies, ultimately delivering over US$100M in cost savings.
In both cases, my focus wasn’t to out-specialise the experts, but to create the conditions where their knowledge could be turned into a reliable, scalable system.”
“How would you approach building an internal AI chatbot using regulatory data?”
What they’re really asking
Do you understand that this is a knowledge + people problem, not just a model problem?
Model Answer
“I would approach it in three layers.
First is knowledge structuring — working with regulatory experts to understand what types of questions they answer, what sources they trust, and where ambiguity typically arises. This helps define how content should be organised and retrieved.
Second is delivery structure — breaking the work into manageable streams such as data preparation, AI development, validation, and user feedback, with clear ownership and checkpoints.
Third is adoption and trust — ensuring the system explains its answers clearly, flags uncertainty when needed, and evolves as regulations change.
My role would be to keep these streams aligned, remove friction between teams, and ensure the system is genuinely useful rather than technically impressive but underutilised.”
“How do you work with very senior engineers or domain experts?”
What they’re really testing
Will you slow them down, or make them more effective?
Model Answer
“I’ve found senior experts don’t need to be managed — they need clarity and protection.
I focus on making expectations explicit early: what problem we’re solving, what ‘good’ looks like, and what constraints matter. I then structure the programme so they can focus on depth, while I handle coordination, dependencies, and communication with the wider organisation.
That approach builds trust quickly, because experts see that I’m not trying to replace their judgment — I’m trying to make sure it’s applied in the right places.”
“How do you manage ambiguity, especially early in AI projects?”
What they’re really asking
Can you lead when requirements aren’t clear?
Model Answer
“I assume ambiguity is normal at the start of AI projects. Instead of trying to eliminate it upfront, I make it visible.
We explicitly document what we know, what we’re assuming, and what we need to learn. Delivery is then structured in phases, where early iterations are about validating understanding rather than shipping features.
This prevents teams from over-committing too early and reduces rework later, especially when expert knowledge or data interpretation evolves.”
“How do you ensure teams across different countries stay aligned?”
What they’re testing
Can you run a global programme without chaos?
Model Answer
“Alignment comes from structure, not control.
I focus on shared artefacts — common documentation, agreed decision logs, and consistent delivery rhythms — so teams don’t rely on informal knowledge or time-zone dependent conversations.
I also make sure decision rights are clear: who decides, who contributes, and who is informed. That clarity matters more than meeting frequency when teams are distributed.”
“How technical do you need to be in this role?”
What they’re really asking
Are you going to pretend to be an engineer?
Model Answer
“I aim to be technically fluent, not hands-on.
I need to understand enough to ask the right questions, surface risks early, and translate between teams. But my value isn’t writing code — it’s ensuring that the right technical decisions are made at the right time and reflected accurately in delivery plans.”
“What do you see as success in the first 6 months?”
Strong answer for Senior Director
“Success would be having a clear delivery framework in place, strong working relationships with regulatory and engineering experts, and a first version of the AI system that people actually use and trust.
Equally important, the team should feel confident that the system can evolve without becoming fragile or overly dependent on a few individuals.”
“Why this role at Dell?”
Keep it grounded, not emotional
“Dell is operating at a scale where AI needs to be practical, reliable, and integrated into real workflows. This role sits exactly at that intersection — taking deep expert knowledge and turning it into something that scales across teams and regions. That’s the kind of problem I’ve spent my career working on.”
One smart question YOU should ask them
Ask this near the end:
“When this AI system is successful, what would regulatory experts say it has changed about how they work day-to-day?”
This shows:
You think in outcomes
You care about adoption
You understand this is a people system, not just tech
Final mindset before the interview
Go in thinking:
“I am here to make very smart people more effective.”
Not:“I need to impress them with knowledge.” That difference will come through in your tone.

This role required close collaboration with vendors and internal engineering teams, strong operational discipline, and a focus on continuous improvement of telemetry, KPIs, and OSS/OAM tooling—experience that closely aligns with DRW’s emphasis on reliability and performance.
Earlier in my career at Singtel, Motorola Solutions, and Alcatel-Lucent, I designed and optimized regional and carrier-grade networks, including LTE, small cells, RF-optimized wireless systems, IP transport, and virtualized network architectures. I have also developed automation tools for performance data processing and worked closely with R&D teams to resolve production issues and improve network efficiency.
I am particularly drawn to DRW’s focus on low-latency networking, automation-first operations, and engineering-driven culture. I enjoy working close to the infrastructure, continuously improving systems through measurement, experimentation, and automation, and collaborating with globally distributed teams in fast-paced environments.
I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background in network infrastructure, automation, and operational excellence can contribute to DRW’s Network Services and Operations team.
Thank you for your time and consideration.
Sincerely,
Freddy Goh Choon Kwang

Dear Hiring Manager,
I am writing to apply for the Solutions Architect (Pre-Sales / System Integration) role. With over 20 years of experience designing and delivering end-to-end enterprise and mission-critical solutions, I bring a strong combination of client-facing pre-sales expertise, system integration depth, and delivery accountability.
Throughout my career, I have led solution architecture engagements from early pre-sales discovery through tendering, POCs, and implementation handover, working closely with sales, engineering, vendors, and partners. My experience spans enterprise and regulated environments, including government, telecom, and smart infrastructure, where solution quality, security, and operational readiness are critical.
In recent years, as an Independent Technology Advisor, I have supported startups and scale-ups in shaping solution architectures, responding to RFPs and RFQs, validating designs, reviewing vendor proposals, and guiding teams through delivery and transition to operations. Previously at GovTech, Motorola Solutions, Singtel, and Alcatel-Lucent, I served in senior solution architecture and pre-sales roles, designing large-scale, multi-vendor systems and supporting complex bids and customer engagements.
I am particularly comfortable translating business requirements into clear, scalable technical architectures, leading customer workshops and presentations, and providing technical governance during delivery. My background across cloud (AWS, hybrid cloud, OpenStack), IoT platforms, networked systems, and system integration allows me to bridge commercial objectives with practical, deployable solutions.
I am excited about the opportunity to contribute as a senior, hands-on Solutions Architect, working closely with clients and internal teams to deliver high-quality, business-aligned solutions. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience can support your pre-sales and system integration objectives.
Thank you for your time and consideration.
Yours sincerely,
Freddy Goh Choon Kwang
